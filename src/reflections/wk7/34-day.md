Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement? I used Pair Programming, Code Documentation, and User Experience.

What went well? 
I was lucky to have a very good group, we all worked together well and everything went smoothly.
We all switched up coding and helping code, as well as problem solving together. It was really great!

What would you do differently?
Honestly, nothing, everything went super smooth and as good as I think it could've. I was very pleased with my group checkpoint.
