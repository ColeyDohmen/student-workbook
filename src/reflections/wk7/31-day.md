What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is when two people work on code together off of one computer. There are two roles, one being the "navigator" who helps lead the other in the right direction, and the other being the "driver" who does most of the typing and coding itself. Roles are commonly switched often.

What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Some benefits are that you could pick up skills from your partner, things you didn't previously know. It can also help with code clarity, saying your code outloud helps you to think things through a little bit more and can help you catch errors you might not have before.

What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
Some drawbacks would be if both parties are not communicative, that could end up with more errors because there wasn't enough communication between both programmers. Sometimes people just don't click and that could cause issues as well. You would need both programmers to be invested in the task at hand, if one is and one isn't, the project will not end well.
