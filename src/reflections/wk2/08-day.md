What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style. You can use console.log(), document.write (), window.alert (). Use console.log when figuring out how to debug something or checking if something in your code is working, use document.write to write into the output of HTML, use window.alert to write into an alert box.

Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML? The Elements tab shows you your HTML/CSS. This tab can be useful when debugging your HTML because it gives you access to your code in real time so when you touch it in your tab, it updates on your page. It makes it so you could solve your issue quicker instead of having to jump between Chrome and VS Code constantly.

Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? A better way to debug your code would be to use debugger in your code and be able to go through your code step by step so you can see what is actually going on with your code. That would be a much better way.
