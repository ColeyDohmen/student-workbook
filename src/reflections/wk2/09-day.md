What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code? Making a plan before starting your code can be super helpful. It helps you get your brain straight with where you should start first and then where to go next, instead of just throwing yourself into it blind and getting overwhelmed.

How do you find answers when you are stuck? You can use previous code of yours, you can look on the Codeworks github for previous code from the week for a refresher, you can use Google, you can also ask any of the TAs or instructors for help. Just make sure to ask for help when you need it. :)
