What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)? There is a Function Declaration, Function Expression, and an Arrow Function Expression. In the first one the function definition is hoisted, while it is not in the second one. The third function is just a shorter way to write the second one.

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are what is given in the function when the function is named. Arguments are the actual values used for when the function is invoked.

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
A higher order function is when a function accepts another function as a parameter, or when it returns a function. An example is array.map .
