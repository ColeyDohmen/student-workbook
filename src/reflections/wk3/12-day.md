What is the purpose of Encapsulation? Encapsulation makes it so we can hide our data from users that we don't want them to see. It makes it so users do not have direct access to anything we don't want them to.

What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix? Some of the problems with closures were leaked implementation details, expanded attack surface for hackers, and breaking changes. If you use the underscore prefix you have to hope that the user knows what it means, but with encapsulation you don't have to worry about that. 

How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
