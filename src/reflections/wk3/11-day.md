What problem does using exports solve? It makes it so developers can now directly reference or include one js file in another. By exporting we can have all of our main scripts in one main script.

How does export differ from export default? By using export you are exporting each module individually. By using export default you are exporting default values.

What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The Module System helps you to expose only the parts of your code that you want exposed. It accesses them through other parts of your code.
