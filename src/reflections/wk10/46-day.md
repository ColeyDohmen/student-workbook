What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
The three categories of data types are, value type, reference type, and pointer type. A value type holds a data value within its own memory space. A reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

A value type holds a data value within its own memory space, they directly contain values.

In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference types contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data. Value types store data directly, while reference types do not store them directly.`
