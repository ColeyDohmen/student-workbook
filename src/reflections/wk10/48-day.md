Read Foundations of C# > C# Enum's and answer the following questions

What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
An Enum is a unique type that allows you to assign symbolic names to integral values. They are used when you want to represent a group of constants (unchangeable/read-only variables).

How can you modify an Enum?
No, you cannot modify an Enum.

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I haven't used Enums yet in my own code. Enums are used to assign names to the integral constants which makes a program easy to read and maintain. Like if you were dealing with days you could use an enum and say Sunday, Monday, instead of 0, 1.
