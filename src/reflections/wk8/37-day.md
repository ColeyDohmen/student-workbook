Why is communication on a small team important?
Communication on a small team is important because it ensures that everyone is on the same page with everything and that everyone is up to date with what is going on. It helps keep things running smoothly and efficiently.

What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side? 
The unattainable triangle is "Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap won't be Good". It talks about how if you are cheap with good service, that things won't get done quickly. If you have good service done at a fast pace, it won't be cheap. If you have a service that is fast and cheap, it won't turn out well in the end.
