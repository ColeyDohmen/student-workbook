Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue and answer the following questions
What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
The three main types of testing are Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End-To-End (E2E) Testing. 
Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation.
Component testing gives users the ability to test Vue components while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.
End-To-End testing tests the entire software product from beginning to end to ensure the application behaves as expected.

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think all of these methods are useful but I think E2E testing would be super useful because you are testing your entire application to check for errors and bugs. It makes sure your whole application is running smoothly and that sounds super beneficial.

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
As I said previously, I think they are all useful but the least useful in my opinion would probably be component testing. It just tests to see if your components can work in isolation and I just don't see how that kind of testing could stand up to E2E testing when talking about how useful they both are.
