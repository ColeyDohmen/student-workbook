Read Working In a Professional Environment > An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio and answer the following questions

What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It compiles your work so you can show off your skills as a developer. It helps to show you know what you are doing.

What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Having multiple projects within your portfolio is a great idea. You can have 4-6 pretty good ones to help show off what you know. 

What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why? 
Probably my later projects, such as KanBan or Bug Log. These more recent projects are full-stack and show off more of what I know when it comes to coding and what my skills currently are.
