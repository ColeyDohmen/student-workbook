Is this where we put our journal entries?
2/1/21 Today we downloaded all the necessary files and programs needed for the course. We worked with the command prompt a bit. We set up GitHub and went over a few of those commands as well.


In your own words, why do we use Git? 
Git allows multiple developers to work on a project at the same time without creating issues or conflict between the codes written. It also helps us with "branches" whenever our codes hit hiccups, we can use a branch to take our code, test it and play with it to try to fix any issues without effecting the master branch in any way.

What are the benefits of having multiple branches? 
Branches help us be able to fix issues within our code without commiting them and potentially ruining a system or causing more hiccups. They are kind of like a little detour for our code until any issues are fixed. They help us test out our code before sending it to the master branch.

What is the difference between Git and GitHub
GitHub is a remote repository that allows us to save our code into the "cloud" just in case anything happens
