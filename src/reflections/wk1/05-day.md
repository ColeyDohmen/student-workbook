This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

At the beginning of this week I was incredibly nervous and unsure about my ability when it comes to code. At the end of the week I feel much more confident and comfortable, I feel excited to continue on and learn more.
