What is the purpose of wire-framing? Wire-framing helps you to visually set up what you want your design to look like without actually doing any coding.

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful? There are low-fidelity wireframes, mid-fidelity wireframes, and high-fidelity wireframes. They are each useful in different situations, you wouldn't want to do a high-fidelity wireframe on an idea you just had and you just want a simple layout and idea for it, you would use a low-fidelity wireframe.

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not? I think they can be worth the TEE that you put into them. They definitely help you give an idea of what you are aiming for but it gives you a much simpler way to achieve that sight. It makes things easier when you can see what you want your end goal to be.
