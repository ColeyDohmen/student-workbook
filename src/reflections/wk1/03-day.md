What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design? I think Figma is a good tool to use, I think it helps to layout everything beforehand so you can visually see what you are shooting for.

Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. 

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone? People like when things are pleasing to the eye, if the website looks bad, it won't be a site they stay on very long. If I go to a website to shop and it looks poorly put together, it's probably not going to be a site that I trust very much or will want to actually purchase anything from. How well your design flows and how well it is put together helps convey a certain level of professionalism.
