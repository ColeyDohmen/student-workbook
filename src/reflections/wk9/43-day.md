Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams
How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
When you have a small team things are more intimate and things are less likely to be lost in translation. Topics are easier to cover and to get across to everyone and make sure everyone is tracking progress. On a larger team things would be harder to track and manage.

Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
Only one is prescribed so everyone can focus all of their energy on one main goal instead of having their focus split between multiple and potentially producing a product with less quality than if they would have focused all of their energy on one sprint at a time.

What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle is "Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap won't be Good". It talks about how if you are cheap with good service, that things won't get done quickly. If you have good service done at a fast pace, it won't be cheap. If you have a service that is fast and cheap, it won't turn out well in the end.
