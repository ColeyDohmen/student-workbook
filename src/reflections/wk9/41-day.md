Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

What technologies and principles are you using in your project? We are using Vue, Auth0, node, router-links, firebase, and css.

What went well so far?
Honestly so far everything is going really well. Our team is very open and communicative with each other and we are always on the same page. We have a stellar team.

What would you do differently? Why?
Maybe taken our time a little more serious this previous week, I know we will be able to get everything done but I'm not sure how rushed we will be by the end of it. But I am confident we will finish for sure.
