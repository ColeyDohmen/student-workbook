Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Understanding Component Based Architecture and answer the following questions

What is Component based architecture?
Component-Based Architechture is a method used for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems.

What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
CBAs have their own interfaces, meaning one component can refresh without affecting other components or the UI as a whole. CBAs also reuse components, meaning you can reuse features but have copies of those features that all act independently.

What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
CBAs single-responsibility and reusability can lead to bloated and polluted views. As well as degraded readability because CBAs encapsulate everything into one space.
