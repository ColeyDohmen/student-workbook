Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions
What is the purpose of Async/Await?
The purpose of async/await is to make asynchronous promises written in a much cleaner, easier way.

What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?
You have to make sure you use async before a function, then use await within the function. 

What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?
They make our asynchronous promises much cleaner and easier to read and use. They also make it so functions can run but the rest of our code doesn't have to wait around for those functions to finish.
