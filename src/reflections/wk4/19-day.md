Read Asynchronous Code > What is REST and answer the following questions

What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It means when a RESTful api is called, whatever the user requested gets transfered by the server as a representation of the state of what was requested.

What does Stateless mean?
Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API.

What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API? 
It is in the form of /API followed by the collection name. If it's operating on one item, it will include the ID of that item.
